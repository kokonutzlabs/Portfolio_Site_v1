# Personal-Portfolio
Hello,
Last year I saw people coding their own sites and thought it was cool. Initially, I figured that since I knew C++ as a beginner, it would be easier to understand—because coding is coding, right? No, it was not the same at all, and CSS was (and still is) the most challenging thing in my opinion when it comes to coding. At first, I had to use premade scripts, but after making a site several times, I finally got the hang of it and was able to make this site by myself. Yes, I have sources listed, but I don’t remember all of the syntax—honestly, I don’t know who would.
###### **I am constantly coming up with different ways to change my site, so enjoy the latest version!**
